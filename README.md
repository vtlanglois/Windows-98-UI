## What is this?

This is a Next.js/React repo for my UI demos built using [7.css](https://github.com/jdan/98.css)

## Goals

With this project, I plan on:
- Improving my React, Next.js, and Node.js skills.
- Practice using Next.js's App router system.
- Develop Tailwind skills.

Above all though, I intend for this work to be a nice, relaxing time for me to program without worrying about deadlines.
